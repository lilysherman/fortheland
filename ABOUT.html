          <h2>About the Artist</h2>
          <img src="house.jpg" class="center">
          <p> Lily Sherman is an artist based in San Jose, California who works in paint, sculpture, and drawing. Through her work, she also explores the way textiles can be incorporated into these practices, whether that be embroidery, yarn, or fabric. </p>

          <p>  Their art focuses on themes such as self-image, adolescence, ancestry, and the relationship between mind and body. She uses her art as a form of storytelling to depict personal experiences or emotions; the art she creates is utilized in building a better understanding of her own self image as it shifts and changes. Their work has ties to surrealist styles, so it often involves autobiographical figures and natural elements used as symbolism. She works to invoke a sense of nostalgia and connection with her audience. </p>
            
           <p> Lily Sherman is currently a student at San Jose State University studying art and education. They hope to get their teaching credential to become an art teacher in the future.
